# Arduino Notification

This application listens on serial port for one of the commands: 'mail' or 'nomail' and sets the servo position sets to a different value depending on the command.

I use it to show envelope icon drawn on a piece of cardboard when I have unread messages on my mailbox.



# Mail Checker

Usage:
`checker.py [-h] [--serial-port SERIAL_PORT] [--imap-server IMAP_SERVER] --imap-user IMAP_USER`

This application checks if there are unread messages on mailbox and sends 'mail' or 'nomail' string on serial port.
